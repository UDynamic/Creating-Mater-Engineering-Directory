# Creating-Mater-Engineering-Directory
The goal for this script was to make a directory to Archive engineering documents of an Oil and Gas Project according to it's Vendor Print Index &amp; Schedule (VPIS) using specific numbering format.

---

so my directory tree looks like this: 
1. Engineering
  1.1. Sent
    1.1.n. Document files ( Using the CSV File, naming them according to this pattern : " Document number - Document Name - Rev 00 to 06 - Blank or RSH"

   *  (what i mean by Rev 00 to 06 is that i want 6 folders for each document, what i mean by Blank or RSH is that i want two folders for each Rev one ending with Rev and the number of rev from 00 to 06, and one with the - RSH at the end of it)

   1.2. Recieved 1.2.n. Document files ( Using the CSV File, naming them according to this pattern : " Document number - Document Name - Rev 00 to 06 - CM "
   *  what i meant by 1.1.n. or 1.2.n. was my way of showing levels of the directory.
